Interests:
- City building and strategy games (Cited from: "I do too but I rarely finish a game haha. Too little late game content", "Yeah I was doing alright and then as soon as I upgraded to tier 3 my town was in shambles. I didn’t notice how demanding it was going to be", "I build my cities close to the borders of others, that way I’m not managing multiple cities at once.", "Can’t really discuss this without your strategy. If you’re setting up on the coast over river, your strategy must involve maritime trades.")

- NFTs and cryptocurrency (Cited from: "the hype has definitely faded, you can see that with the price as well as the number of people discussing it on X, or even here", "I see so many one-off posts on this community with only a couple responses.")
- Basketball (Cited from: "Ok 5 more min with a 5pt deficit. I’m ready to be disappointed again", "I’m not going to be disappointed anymore. I know how the warriors give us slight hope just to disappoint", "Didn’t doubt warriors would lose this one", "Am I watching basketball with ads or ads with some basketball sprinkled in between", "I’m definitely done after curry.")

- Somewhat cynical and realistic (Cited from: comments on the decline of NFT hype,  "imagine making 60fps videos with photos from OAI images. nothing on the internet can be trusted")
